Use the legal topics (INSS, IRRF, 13th Salary, FGTS) as the basis for scenario-based challenges.1. The "Payroll Detective" Challenge (15 minutes)This scenario-based game directly links Factorial's input to Bernhoeft's output.Setup: Present 3-4 simplified employee scenarios (using an example employee like "João da Silva").The Scenario Card:Base Salary: R$ 3,000.00Factorial Data Input: João took 5 days of Férias (PTO) and had 3 unjustified absences (faltas) this month (tracked in Factorial).The Challenge: Ask the employees (using a poll tool like Mentimeter or simply the chat):What mandatory deduction is always taken first? (Answer: INSS)Will João lose a portion (an avo) of his 13º Salário this month due to his absences? (Answer: Yes, because 3 faltas and Férias likely mean he worked less than 15 days in the month.)How does Bernhoeft calculate the FGTS? (Answer: 8% of the gross pay.)Goal: Employees must identify how the Factorial data points (the faltas) trigger the legal calculation rules.2. "The CLT Compliance Check" (10 minutes)Use a rapid-fire True or False format focusing on common misconceptions.QuestionTopicExpected AnswerT/F: The employee always pays 6% of their base salary for Vale-Transporte.Vale-TransporteFALSE (They pay a maximum of 6%; if the ticket cost is lower, they pay the actual cost.)T/F: Only the base salary is used to calculate the 13th Salary.13º SalárioFALSE (It must include the average of variables like Overtime (Hora Extra) and commissions.)T/F: Our HR team is responsible for manually calculating the INSS deduction.Bernhoeft's RoleFALSE (Bernhoeft handles the calculation based on the Factorial data.)3. The "Benefit Blunder" (10 minutes)Focus on the impact of Factorial's Benefits module on the paycheck.Scenario: An employee forgot to update their profile in Factorial and is still receiving a benefit they no longer use (e.g., private transport help).Question: What is the consequence for the employee and for Factorial (the company)?Goal: Emphasize that old/incorrect benefit data in Factorial leads to:Employee Consequence: Incorrect deduction or tax liability.Company Consequence: Potential legal risk if deductions (like the 6% Vale-Transporte) are handled incorrectly, requiring correction through Bernhoeft.The provided content structure is perfectly suited to support these interactive segments. It gives you the "What" (the legal rules) and the "Why" (Factorial's role) needed for a compelling training session.
